AFNI 1st-level results for subject 1, from task001_run001 of the OpenfMRI ds000006 living-nonliving decision experiment, used for exporting uncorrected p=0.001 NIDM-results with a one-sample t-test for the contrast mirror vs. plain.

For task001_run001 subjects had to complete 64 trials, where each trial consisted of a word being presented to the subject in either plain or mirror-reversed text for which they had to respond as to whether the word named a living or nonliving entity by pressing the corresponding button. Words were chosen from a list permuted across participants and presented pseudorandomly such that the run included 32 plain and 32 mirror-reversed words for each subject. Subjects were not given feedback on their responses. The response window for each trial was 3.25 seconds, with a variable interstimulus interval of mean 6.28 seconds.
