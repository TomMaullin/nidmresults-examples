AFNI single-subject t-test results from AFNI data 6 (speech perception task), run 1, with uncorrected p=0.001 and a minimum cluster size of 2 voxels. 

The basis function is set to 'gamma'.

Contrasts used: auditory-reliable vs visual reliable. 

Subjects watched clips of a person speaking clearly but looking blurred (auditory-reliable condition) and speaking with muffled speech but appearing in focus (visual reliable condition). No response was required from subjects.

Each run consisted of 10 blocks, 5 of which consisted of auditory-reliable stimuli and 5 of visual-reliable stimuli. Each block consisted of 10 trials, lasting 20 seconds each (1 second for stimulus presentation, 1 second for inter stimulus interval). Baseline blocks consisted of 10-second fixation points.
