AFNI single subject t-test results from subject 01, tone counting task, taken from OpenfMRI (BIDS) DS000011 classification learning and tone counting experiment. 

Results are corrected for multiple testing with Monte Carlo simulations (family-wise error) at p<0.05, with a cluster-forming threshold of p<0.001. 

Contrasts used:
tone counting vs. baseline
tone counting with probe vs. baseline
