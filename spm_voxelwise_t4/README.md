Tone Counting vs Baseline

For task001_run001, subjects were played a stream of high and low-pitched tones and told to keep a running count of the number of high tones. This was used as a training exercise for task003, where subjects would have to repeat this tone counting exercise as part of a dual-task where they would also have to complete a probabilistic classification exercise based on predicting the weather after being shown a combination of 1 to 3 (out of 4 potential) cards in tandem.
