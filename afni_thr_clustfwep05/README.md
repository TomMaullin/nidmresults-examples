**AFNI** single subject t-test results from **subject 01**, using a cluster-wise FWE corrected threshold p-value of 0.05, and cluster-defining threshold p-value of 0.001, taken from OpenfMRI **DS000011** classification learning and tone counting experiment (cf. https://openfmri.org/dataset/ds000011/)

 - *Task*: tone counting task
 - *Contrast*: Tone Counting vs Baseline
 - *Variant*: **Cluster-wise FWE p\<0.05, cluster-defining threshold p\<0.001**
